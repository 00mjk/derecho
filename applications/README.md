## Applications

This directory contains various executables that can be compiled against the Derecho library. The applications are organized into the following subdirectories:
- **Demos** contains example programs that demonstrate different aspects of Derecho's functionality.
- **Tests** contains unit tests, performance tests, and scalability tests.
- **Archive** is a collection of experimental programs that were used internally at Cornell to help develop and test Derecho. They are not intended to be useful or understandable for the general public.
